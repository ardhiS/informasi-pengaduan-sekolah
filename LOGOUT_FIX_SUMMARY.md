# 🔧 Logout Flow Fix Summary

## ✅ Fixed Issues:

### 1. **ProtectedRoute Redirect**

- **Before:** Redirected to `/welcome` after logout
- **After:** Redirects to **Landing Page (`/`)** when not authenticated

### 2. **Header Logout Handler**

- **Before:** Only cleared auth data
- **After:** Clears auth data + navigates to **Landing Page (`/`)**

### 3. **Simple Redirect Logic**

- **All roles:** Logout → **Landing Page (`/`)**
- **Clean and consistent** user experience

## 🎯 How It Works Now:

### Login Process:

1. User logs in with credentials
2. JWT token decoded and role extracted
3. **Role saved to localStorage** as `lastRole`
4. User redirected to `/dashboard`

### Logout Process:

1. User clicks logout button
2. **Header.jsx:** Calls logout + navigates to **Landing Page (`/`)**
3. **AuthContext:** Clears all auth data including `lastRole`
4. **ProtectedRoute:** If accessed without auth, redirects to **Landing Page (`/`)**

## 🧪 Test Instructions:

### Test 1: Normal Logout

1. Login as siswa: `siswa01/siswa123`
2. Navigate to any protected route
3. Click logout button
4. Should redirect to **Landing Page (`/`)**

### Test 2: Direct Access After Logout

1. After logout, try accessing `/dashboard` directly
2. Should redirect to **Landing Page (`/`)**
3. User can then choose appropriate login from landing page

### Test 3: Multiple Role Testing

```bash
# Test each role logout - all should go to landing page:
# 1. Login guru01/guru123 → logout → should go to /
# 2. Login admin01/admin123 → logout → should go to /
# 3. Login siswa01/siswa123 → logout → should go to /
```

# Test each role logout:

# 1. Login guru01/guru123 → logout → should go to /login/guru

# 2. Login admin01/admin123 → logout → should go to /login/admin

# 3. Login siswa01/siswa123 → logout → should go to /login/siswa

```

## 📋 Files Modified:

1. **Header.jsx** - Added navigate after logout
2. **ProtectedRoute.jsx** - Smart redirect based on role
3. **AuthContext.jsx** - Store/clear lastRole

## ✅ Expected Behavior:

- ❌ **OLD:** Logout → `/welcome`
- ✅ **NEW:** Logout → **Landing Page (`/`)**

The logout flow now redirects users to the main landing page where they can choose their appropriate login method!
```
