### 2. Updated Components

#### Header Component (`Header.jsx`)

- ✅ Integrated ThemeLanguageToggle component
- ✅ Dark mode styling for all elements
- ✅ Translated role descriptions and UI text
- ✅ Dynamic color schemes based on theme
- ✅ Responsive design maintained across themes

#### Dashboard Page (`Dashboard.jsx`)

## Technical Implementation

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Context Integration**: All major components now import and use ThemeContext and translation utilities
2. **Conditional Styling**: CSS classes dynamically change based on `isDarkMode` state
3. **Translation Keys**: All user-facing text uses `t()` function with fallback values
4. **State Persistence**: Theme and language preferences stored in localStorage
5. **Component Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with reusable ThemeLanguageToggle

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:

1. **Toggle Theme**: Click the sun/moon icon in the header to switch between light and dark mode
2. **Change Language**: Click the globe icon in the header to switch between Indonesian and English
3. **Persistence**: Preferences are automatically saved and restored on page reload

### For Developers:

1. **Add New Translations**: Add keys to both `id` and `en` objects in `translations.js`
2. **Use in Components**: Import `useTheme` and `useTranslation` hooks
3. **Apply Dark Mode**: Use conditional classes based on `isDarkMode` state
4. **Translate Text**: Use `t('key', 'fallback')` for all user-facing strings

## Browser Testing

### Test Steps:

1. Start frontend: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to any page (Dashboard, Complaints, etc.)
3. Click theme toggle in header - verify all elements respond
4. Click language toggle - verify all text changes
5. Refresh page - verify preferences are persisted
6. Test on mobile devices - verify responsive design works

### Expected Results:

- ✅ All pages support both light and dark themes
- ✅ All text changes when language is switched
- ✅ Smooth transitions between modes
- ✅ Consistent styling across all components
- ✅ No broken layouts or styling issues
- ✅ Preferences persist across browser sessions

## Next Steps

### Remaining Tasks:

1. **Complete Complaints Page**: Finish dark mode implementation for all Complaints page components
2. **Other Pages**: Apply same pattern to Users, Classes, Subjects, and Profile pages
3. **Forms and Modals**: Ensure all form elements and modals support dark mode
4. **Error Pages**: Update 404 and error pages with theme support
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Test and refine mobile experience

### Enhancement Opportunities:

1. **System Theme Detection**: Auto-detect user's OS theme preference
2. **More Languages**: Add support for additional languages
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG compliance for color contrast
4. **Animation**: Add subtle animations for theme transitions
5. **Custom Themes**: Allow users to create custom color schemes

## Conclusion

The dark/light mode and EN/ID translation features have been successfully implemented across the core components of the application. Users can now switch between themes and languages seamlessly, with all preferences being persisted automatically. The implementation follows React best practices and maintains the existing responsive design and user experience.
